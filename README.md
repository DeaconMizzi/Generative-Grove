# Generative Grove
Generative Grove is an interactive digital art experience where code and nature intertwine. Plant virtual trees with a click, watch their branches grow in recursive patterns, and see them sway in response to real-time weather data. Fireflies drift through the forest, while a dynamic background reflects the passing of time and atmospheric conditions.
